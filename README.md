The goal of this project was to introduce us to the vast world of Arduino, microcontrollers, and robotics. We built a fully maneuverable robotic arm capable of performing heavy lifting tasks.

Hereâ€™s how it works:
- The project uses four **SG90 180-degree mini servos** as the joints of the arm, controlled by four **potentiometers**.
- The analog readings from the potentiometers are mapped to translate into the angle of rotation for the motors.
- Also another feature is that with a single button push you can make it repeat its actions.
- The motors, using `PWM`, provide the desired movement.

Although it is a basic project, we learned a great deal from it.
